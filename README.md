# Linh Nguyen My

I am a self-taught software engineer still early in my career. My first introduction to programming was using Ruby which I was introduced to whilst on the CodeFirst:Girls course in January. Following the course, I then took this further by learning about doing test driven development using RSpec, I have enjoyed this approach to development and have shared my learnings on my GitHub and medium blog. I have since moved on from Ruby, exposing myself to a variety of different technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Outside of learning to code I have also enjoyed sharing my knowledge with others, recently have becoming an instructor at CodeFirst:Girls on their beginner HTML/CSS course. I have found sharing my knowledge with others to be very rewarding.
